## 📌 Status

### Day 1
- Learned how Java works internally (JVM, JRE, JDK basics)  
- Wrote first "Hello World" program  
- Explored JShell for quick testing  
- Learned about variables and data types in Java  

### Day 2
- Practiced control flow statements (if/else, switch)  
- Worked with loops (for, while, do-while, enhanced for loop)
- Learned about operators (arithmetic, logical, relational, ternary)  
- Solved basic pattern and logic-building exercises

### Day 3
- Understood Classes, Objects, and how Java’s OOP structure works
- Explored Methods, return types, and parameters  
- Studied Attributes (fields) inside a class
- Learned about Strings and common operations  
- Practiced working with Arrays (1D and basic multi-dimensional)

### Day 4
- Understood how inheritance enables sharing and extending behavior between classes  
- Learned how static variables, methods, and blocks work at the class level  
- Studied how the final keyword applies to variables, methods, and classes  
- Saw how final variables act as constants, final methods cannot be overridden, and final classes cannot be inherited
