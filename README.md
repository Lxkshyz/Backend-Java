## 📌 Status

### Day 1
- Learned how Java works internally (JVM, JRE, JDK basics)  
- Wrote first "Hello World" program  
- Explored JShell for quick testing  
- Learned about variables and data types in Java  

### Day 2
- Practiced control flow statements (if/else, switch)  
- Worked with loops (for, while, do-while, enhanced for loop)
- Learned about operators (arithmetic, logical, relational, ternary)  
- Solved basic pattern and logic-building exercises

### Day 3
- Understood Classes, Objects, and how Java’s OOP structure works
- Explored Methods, return types, and parameters  
- Studied Attributes (fields) inside a class
- Learned about Strings and common operations  
- Practiced working with Arrays (1D and basic multi-dimensional)

### Day 4
- Understood how inheritance enables sharing and extending behavior between classes  
- Learned how static variables, methods, and blocks work at the class level  
- Studied how the final keyword applies to variables, methods, and classes  
- Saw how final variables act as constants, final methods cannot be overridden, and final classes cannot be inherited  

### Day 5
- Understood the concept of super keyword.
- Deeper insight of inheritance, and this keyword and method overloading and overriding.
- Understood polymorphism concept.

### Day 6
- Learned Abstraction (abstract classes and abstract methods)
- Studied Inner Classes (non-static & static nested classes)
- Played with Anonymous Inner Classes (one-time override)
- Understood Interfaces (multiple inheritance of behavior, default/static methods)

### Day 7
- Studied enums in Java
- Learned Exception Handling in Java
- Practiced multiple catch blocks
- Created my own custom exception class

### Day 8
- Explored **Maven** and why it's used in Java projects
- Understood how Maven manages dependencies and builds
- Learned about **POM.xml** structure
- Studied `groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, and packaging
- Explored Maven lifecycle (clean, validate, compile, test, install, deploy)

### Day 9
- Practiced editing and customizing **POM.xml**
- Added dependencies
- Explored Maven repositories (local, central)
- Learned how Maven automatically downloads required libraries
- Tested various Maven plugins inside the POM

### Day 10
- Created simple Maven project structures
- Explored project hierarchy (`src/main/java`, `src/test/java`)
- Observed how the `target/` folder is generated
- Practiced using basic Maven commands (`mvn clean`, `mvn compile`, `mvn package`)
- Built and inspected JAR files

### Day 11
- Created a **sample Maven project from scratch**
- Added custom dependencies and validated builds
- Learned how Maven simplifies modern Java application setup
- Understood how to configure project-wide properties in `pom.xml`

### Day 12
- Explored **JDBC** fundamentals
- Connected Java to MySQL using `DriverManager`
- Created a basic `Database.java` class to test DB connectivity
- Performed insert/select/Truncate operations using Java
- Understood `PreparedStatement` and how SQL queries execute through JDBC
